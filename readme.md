# tomer.link shortener

> A Netlify-based personal URL shortener that generates funny adjective-animal phrases.

This project was heavily inspired by [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com)'s [netlify-shortener](https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener).

I thought about using his project for my personal URL shortener, but ultimately decided to implement one myself for the following reasons:

- I wanted to challenge myself.
- I wanted my URL shortener to generate funny adjective-animal phrases like `cute-doodle` and `crypto-bear` for the short links instead of random characters.
- I knew it would be fun!

You can view my redirects in the [\_redirects file](https://github.com/TomerAberbach/tomer.link/blob/master/_redirects). For example, [tomer.link/present-robin](https://tomer.link/present-robin) was randomly generated to redirect to [kentcdodds.com](https://kentcdodds.com).

You can also view the [`short`](https://github.com/TomerAberbach/dotfiles/blob/master/home/tomeraberbach/.config/fish/functions/short.fish) and [`redirects`](https://github.com/TomerAberbach/dotfiles/blob/master/home/tomeraberbach/.config/fish/functions/redirects.fish) fish shell functions that I use to make and edit my redirects, respectively.
